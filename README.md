In this assignment first we had executed the given code and then  Adding  one more hidden layer to autoencoder
Then doing  the prediction on the test data and then visualize one of the reconstructed version of that test data.
Also, visualize the same test data before reconstruction using Matplotlib
Repeat the  above process on the denoisening autoencoder and 
plot loss and accuracy using the history object
